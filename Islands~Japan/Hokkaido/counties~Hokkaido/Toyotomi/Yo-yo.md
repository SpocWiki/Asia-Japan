> A **Yo-yo** (also spelled yoyo) is a toy consisting of an axle connected to two disks, 
> and a string looped around the axle, similar to a spool. 
> 
> It is an ancient toy documented since 440 BC. 
> It was also called a bandalore in the 18th century.
>
> It is played by holding the free end of the string known as the handle 
> (by inserting one finger—usually the middle or ring finger—into a slip knot), 
> allowing gravity (or the force of a throw and gravity) to spin the yo-yo 
> and unwind the string (similar to how a pullstring works). 
> 
> The player then allows the yo-yo to wind itself back to the player's hand, 
> exploiting its spin (and the associated rotational energy). 
> This is often called "yo-yoing" or "playing yo-yo".
>
> In the simplest play, the string is intended to be wound on the spool by hand; the yo-yo is thrown downward, hits the end of the string then winds up the string toward the hand, and finally the yo-yo is grabbed, ready to be thrown again. One of the most basic tricks is called the sleeper, where the yo-yo spins at the end of the string for a noticeable amount of time before returning to the hand.
